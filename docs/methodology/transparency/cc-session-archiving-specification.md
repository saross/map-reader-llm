# Specification: Archiving Claude Code Sessions

**Version**: 1.0-draft
**Date**: 2026-01-08
**Author**: Shawn Ross (with Claude)
**Context**: VLM Burial Mound Detection Project; RDA IG on Documenting GenAI Interactions

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document specifies an approach to archiving Claude Code (CC) sessions that balances completeness, findability, and practical usability. It is designed to serve as:

1. A working specification for the VLM burial mound detection project
2. A model implementation for the RDA Interest Group on Documenting GenAI Interactions
3. A testbed for the "Three Ps" framework (Prompt, Process, Provenance)

### 1.2 The "Write-Once-Read-Never" Problem

Traditional documentation approaches often fail because elaborate derivative views:

- Impose maintenance burden that exceeds their value
- Drift from source truth over time
- Represent speculative effort for views that may never be read

The alternative—**store complete, query on demand**—aligns better with actual usage patterns: archives are accessed rarely, but intensively when needed.

### 1.3 Design Philosophy

This specification adopts three core principles:

1. **Canonical completeness**: The JSONL archive is the source of truth; nothing is discarded
2. **Metadata for finding, not reading**: Structured metadata enables discovery; content is accessed from the canonical source
3. **LLM-intermediated access**: Rather than pre-generating human-readable views, provide query tools (prompts and scripts) that extract views on demand

This approach treats LLM session archives the same way we treat other research data: preserve the complete record, describe it with FAIR-aligned metadata, and provide tools for access.

### 2.2 Component Roles

| Component | Role | Access Pattern |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| `session.jsonl` | Canonical archive | Query on demand |
| `session.meta.json` | Findability metadata | Catalogue/search |
| `CATALOG.json` | Session index | Browse/filter |
| `queries/*.md` | LLM extraction prompts | Interactive analysis |
| `queries/*.py` | Deterministic extraction | Batch processing |

### 2.3 Rationale for LLM-Intermediated Access

Pre-generating comprehensive human-readable transcripts has several problems:

1. **Scale**: A 2-hour CC session can produce 50,000+ lines of JSONL; any "complete" MD version would be similarly unwieldy
2. **Purpose mismatch**: Different readers need different views (summary vs. decisions vs. methodology)
3. **Maintenance**: Schema changes require regenerating all derived views

LLM-intermediated access solves these by:

1. **Generating views on demand**: Only create what's actually needed
2. **Adapting to reader needs**: Same archive, different queries for different purposes
3. **Leveraging LLM comprehension**: LLMs can extract meaning, not just reformat

The queries themselves become part of the documentation infrastructure—reusable, versionable, improvable.

## 4. Query Prompts for LLM-Intermediated Access

### 4.1 Session Summary

**File**: `queries/summarize-session.md`

```markdown
# Session Summary Query

You are analysing a Claude Code session transcript in JSONL format. Each line 
is a JSON object representing one event in the conversation (human messages, 
assistant messages, tool calls, tool results, thinking blocks).

## Task

Provide a structured summary including:

### 1. Purpose
What was the user trying to accomplish? (1-2 sentences)

### 2. Key Activities
What major tasks were performed? (bullet list, 3-7 items, in rough 
chronological order)

### 3. Decisions Made
What significant decisions or conclusions were reached? Include:
- Technical decisions (e.g., "chose Option A over Option B")
- Findings (e.g., "identified 5 issues in document X")
- Agreements (e.g., "will proceed with approach Y")

### 4. Artifacts Produced
What files were created or significantly modified? List with:
- File path
- Brief description of content/purpose

### 5. Open Items
What was left unfinished or flagged for follow-up? (if any)

### 6. Session Statistics
- Duration (from first to last timestamp)
- Approximate turn count
- Notable tool usage patterns

## Output Format

Use markdown with the headers above. Be concise—this is a reference summary, 
not a complete transcript. Aim for 300-500 words total.

## Session Data

[Paste or attach session.jsonl content]
```

### 4.2 Decision Extraction

**File**: `queries/extract-decisions.md`

```markdown
# Decision Extraction Query

You are analysing a Claude Code session to identify decisions, conclusions, 
and commitments made during the conversation.

## Task

Extract all instances where:
- A **decision** was made ("we'll go with Option A", "let's use X approach")
- A **conclusion** was reached ("this confirms that...", "the issue is...")
- A **commitment** was made ("I'll do X before Y", "next step is...")
- A **problem** was identified and resolved
- A **question** was answered definitively

## Output Format

For each item extracted:

### [Brief descriptive title]

- **Type**: Decision | Conclusion | Commitment | Resolution | Answer
- **Context**: What prompted this (1-2 sentences)
- **Outcome**: What was decided/concluded (1-2 sentences)
- **Confidence**: High | Medium | Low (based on how definitive the statement was)
- **Location**: Early | Middle | Late in conversation

## Guidance

- Focus on substantive decisions, not trivial ones ("let's use markdown" is 
  trivial; "let's use Option A for the experimental design" is substantive)
- Include decisions made by both human and assistant
- Note if a decision was revisited or changed later in the conversation
- Group related decisions if they form a coherent thread

## Session Data

[Paste or attach session.jsonl content]
```

### 4.3 Artifact Extraction

**File**: `queries/extract-artifacts.md`

```markdown
# Artifact Extraction Query

You are analysing a Claude Code session to identify all files that were 
created, modified, or significantly referenced.

## Task

Identify all artifacts (files) involved in the session:

### 1. Files Created
Files that did not exist before and were created during the session.
Look for: `create_file` tool calls, `write` operations in bash

### 2. Files Modified  
Existing files that were changed during the session.
Look for: `str_replace` tool calls, `sed`/`echo >>` in bash, explicit 
mentions of updating files

### 3. Files Read/Referenced
Files that were examined but not modified.
Look for: `view` tool calls, `cat`/`head`/`tail` in bash, file content 
appearing in conversation

## Output Format

For each artifact:

| File | Action | Description | Tool Used |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| path/to/file.md | Created | Brief description | create_file |
| other/file.json | Modified | What changed | str_replace |
| input/doc.md | Read | Why it was read | view |

## Additional Information

After the table, note:
- Any files that were created then deleted (intermediate artifacts)
- Any failed file operations (attempted but failed)
- File relationships (e.g., "X was created based on template Y")

## Session Data

[Paste or attach session.jsonl content]
```

### 4.4 Methodology Extraction

**File**: `queries/extract-methodology.md`

```markdown
# Methodology Extraction Query

You are analysing a Claude Code session to extract methodology documentation 
suitable for a research methods section or supplementary materials.

## Task

Document the methodology used in this session as if writing for a 
methods section of a paper. Include:

### 1. Objective
What was the session trying to accomplish? Frame in research terms.

### 2. Approach
What approach or workflow was used? Describe the logical steps.

### 3. Tools and Parameters
- Model used (extract from conversation or metadata)
- Key parameters or settings
- External tools or scripts invoked

### 4. Data Inputs
What data or documents were used as inputs? Note versions if mentioned.

### 5. Process
Describe the actual process followed:
- Was it iterative? How many iterations?
- Were there decision points? What drove the decisions?
- Were there corrections or backtracking?

### 6. Validation
How were outputs validated or checked?
- Manual review?
- Automated checks?
- Cross-referencing?

### 7. Outputs
What were the final outputs? How do they relate to the research objectives?

## Output Format

Write in third person, past tense, suitable for inclusion in a methods 
section. Aim for 200-400 words. Be specific about what was done, not 
what could be done.

## Session Data

[Paste or attach session.jsonl content]
```

### 4.5 Error and Issue Extraction

**File**: `queries/extract-issues.md`

```markdown
# Error and Issue Extraction Query

You are analysing a Claude Code session to identify errors, issues, 
problems, and their resolutions.

## Task

Extract all instances of:

### 1. Errors Encountered
- Tool failures
- Code errors
- Parsing failures
- API errors

### 2. Issues Identified
- Problems found in documents/code being reviewed
- Inconsistencies discovered
- Gaps or omissions noted

### 3. Misunderstandings
- Cases where the assistant misunderstood the request
- Cases where clarification was needed
- Incorrect assumptions that were corrected

### 4. Resolutions
For each error/issue, note how it was resolved (if it was).

## Output Format

### Errors Encountered

| Error | Context | Resolution | Resolved? |
|-------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Brief description | What was being attempted | How it was fixed | Yes/No/Partial |

### Issues Identified

| Issue | Severity | Location | Resolution |
|-------|----------|----------|------------|
| Brief description | High/Medium/Low | Where found | How addressed |

### Misunderstandings

| Misunderstanding | Clarification | Impact |
|------------------|---------------|--------|
| What was misunderstood | How it was corrected | Effect on session |

## Session Data

[Paste or attach session.jsonl content]
```

## 5. Deterministic Conversion Script

### 5.1 Purpose

While LLM-intermediated access is preferred for analysis, a deterministic 
script provides:

1. Consistent, reproducible output
2. Batch processing capability
3. Fallback when LLM access is unavailable
4. Baseline for comparison with LLM-generated summaries

### 5.2 Script: `convert-to-markdown.py`

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

### 5.3 Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic conversion (thinking collapsed, tool output truncated)
python convert-to-markdown.py session.jsonl > session.md

# Full transcript with all details
python convert-to-markdown.py session.jsonl \
    --include-thinking \
    --include-tool-output \
    > session-full.md

# For platforms that don't support <details> tags
python convert-to-markdown.py session.jsonl --no-collapse > session.md
```

## 8. Alignment with Standards

### 8.1 FAIR Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **F1**: Globally unique identifier | Session UUID in metadata |
| **F2**: Rich metadata | Comprehensive session.meta.json |
| **F3**: Metadata includes identifier | `session.id` field |
| **F4**: Registered/indexed | CATALOG.json provides searchable index |
| **A1**: Retrievable by identifier | Directory structure uses slug |
| **A2**: Metadata accessible | JSON format, documented schema |
| **I1**: Formal language | JSON with defined schema |
| **I2**: FAIR vocabularies | ISO 8601 dates, standard field names |
| **I3**: Qualified references | `related_sessions` with explicit relationships |
| **R1**: Plurality of attributes | Extensive metadata fields |
| **R1.1**: Clear usage license | Documented in project |
| **R1.2**: Provenance | `provenance` section, Three Ps |
| **R1.3**: Domain standards | Aligned with RDA IG Three Ps framework |

### 8.2 RDA IG Three Ps Framework

This specification implements the Three Ps framework:

| P | Implementation |
|---|----------------|
| **Prompt** | `three_ps.prompt_summary` + full conversation in JSONL |
| **Process** | `three_ps.process_summary` + `statistics` + `artifacts` |
| **Provenance** | `provenance` section + `context.related_sessions` |

### 8.3 Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) Compatibility

The session directory structure is compatible with RO-Crate packaging:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1/context",
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@id": "./",
      "@type": "Dataset",
      "name": "CC Session: Preregistration Review",
      "description": "Claude Code session for preregistration consistency review",
      "hasPart": [
        {"@id": "session.jsonl"},
        {"@id": "session.meta.json"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "@id": "session.jsonl",
      "@type": "File",
      "name": "Session transcript",
      "encodingFormat": "application/jsonl"
    },
    {
      "@id": "session.meta.json",
      "@type": "File", 
      "name": "Session metadata",
      "encodingFormat": "application/json",
      "conformsTo": "https://example.org/schemas/genai-session-meta/v1.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 9. Open Questions

### 9.1 For Discussion

1. **Thinking block handling**: Should thinking blocks be included in the canonical JSONL even though they may contain internal reasoning that wasn't intended for the user?

2. **Tool output completeness**: Some tool outputs (e.g., viewing large files) can be very large. Should there be a size threshold for inclusion, or should everything be preserved?

3. **Multi-session threads**: How should we represent sessions that span multiple CC invocations but form a logical unit of work?

4. **Web app sessions**: This specification focuses on CC. How should it be adapted for Claude web app sessions (which have different export formats)?

5. **Automated metadata extraction**: How much of session.meta.json can be reliably auto-generated vs. requiring manual input?

### 9.2 Future Extensions

- Integration with version control (linking sessions to git commits)
- Automated artifact tracking (detecting created/modified files)
- Session comparison tools (diff between related sessions)
- Aggregated project-level documentation generation
