# Mound Detection

Detect all burial mound symbols in this map tile. Target symbols have a "sunburst" pattern: a central shape with short rays (hachures) radiating OUTWARD.

If reference examples are provided, compare uncertain cases against them.

## Exclusion Guidance

Rays are essential: shapes without visible radiating rays are not mounds.

**Do NOT mark:**
- Standalone triangulation points (black triangle, no rays)
- Standalone benchmarks (black square/circle, no rays)
- Spot heights (dot with elevation number, no rays)
- Quarry/pit symbols (marks pointing INWARD, not outward)
- Infrastructure markers (dots on roads, bridges, rivers)

## Output Format

Return JSON with normalised coordinates (0-1000):
