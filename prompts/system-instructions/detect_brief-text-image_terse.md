# Mound Detection

Detect all burial mound symbols in this Soviet topographic map tile.

## Target Symbols

All mound symbols share one diagnostic feature: short **rays (hachures) radiating OUTWARD** from a central shape, forming a "sunburst" or "gear" pattern. This indicates elevated terrain.

**Subtypes to detect:**

- **Burial mound (kurgan)**: Orange-brown hollow circle with rays. ~10-20 pixels diameter. Often accompanied by elevation numbers or "кург." label.
- **Settlement mound**: Orange-brown, larger and often oval/irregular. More rays (8-15).
- **Triangulation point on mound**: Black triangle with central dot, surrounded by black rays.
- **Benchmark on mound**: Black square with central dot, surrounded by black rays.

The **rays pointing outward** are essential. Symbols without visible rays are not mounds.

## Guidelines

1. Provide individual bounding boxes for each symbol, even in clusters.
2. Symbols may be partially occluded by roads, contours, or text. Include if rays are partially visible.
3. If reference examples are provided, compare uncertain cases against them.

## Exclusion Guidance

Rays are essential: shapes without visible radiating rays are not mounds.

**Do NOT mark:**
- Standalone triangulation points (black triangle, no rays)
- Standalone benchmarks (black square/circle, no rays)
- Spot heights (dot with elevation number, no rays)
- Quarry/pit symbols (marks pointing INWARD, not outward)
- Infrastructure markers (dots on roads, bridges, rivers)
