Data:

* Mapmounds.zip contains the shapefiles of digitized points for 2017-2018 season in both projected (32635) and unprojected (4326) format. There are 10825 points as I filtered away the two empty points (no timestamp)


Maps K-35

* Are all in geotif format projected to 32635  
* Named ones are from 2017, the one ending in 32635 is from 2018\. 

Note: 

* All of this was showing fine for me in QGIS  
* Mapmounds were produced using the MapMoundLoad.R script in  [https://github.com/adivea/MapMoundsDigitized.git](https://github.com/adivea/MapMoundsDigitized.git)
