## How to read this table

- **TP / FP / FN**: Hungarian-matching counts against the extended GT at R.
  Every reviewer-promoted phantom within R is added to the GT before matching.
- **n_ref_student**: Student GT points scoped to the evaluation tile bounds
  (the denominator without any human-review correction).
- **n_promoted@R**: Number of reviewer-promoted phantoms included in the
  extended GT at this R. Yesterday's 472 mound labels appear at every R ≥ 50.
  Today's shell-stratified mound labels accumulate as R rises: +2 @50 m,
  +121 @75 m, +47 @100 m, +19 @125 m, +11 @150 m.
- **n_ref_extended**: Scoped extended-GT count at R (student GT scoped ∪
  in-scope phantoms at R). This is the recall denominator.
- **F1 [95 % CI]**: Corrected F1 at R with tile-level bootstrap CI.

## Comparison to yesterday's 50 m result

Yesterday's single-buffer correction (``compute_corrected_f1_human_reviewed.py``)
produced **F1 = 0.8295** at R = 50 m via an analytic adjustment to measured
counts (moved 472 FPs into TP and added them to the GT denominator, without
re-running Hungarian). This script's R = 20 m row
(**F1 = 0.6796**) re-runs Hungarian over extended GT including
the 2 today-corrections at 50 m. Expected ΔF1 ≈ +0.003 versus yesterday's
number. The two numbers are methodologically close but not identical —
Approach B allows detections to rematch optimally against the extended GT,
which can free a detection previously bound to a distant student-GT point
to pair with a closer phantom.

## Obs 272 caveat — the 150 m row is an upper bound

Obs 272 in ``docs/notes/reflections/working-notes.md`` shows the
attractor-pull effect (reviewer confirmations concentrating closer to the
detection than a uniform within-tile null would predict) is statistically
significant only through 125 m. At the (125, 150] shell the shell-specific
mound-confirmation rate is indistinguishable from the within-tile random-
placement null, and the (150, 286] shell ("200 m" sentinel in today's CSV)
is completely indistinguishable.

**Implication for interpretation:**

- **R ≤ 125 m**: corrected F1 / P / R are practitioner-meaningful. The
  reviewer-promoted phantoms in these shells are confirming detections
  genuinely spatially associated with visible mound symbols.
- **R = 150 m**: corrected F1 at 150 m is an **upper bound on achievable
  practitioner recall**, not a practitioner-useful operating point.
  Including the 11 mounds in the (125, 150] shell inflates recall in a way
  the attractor-pull null cannot distinguish from coincidental alignment.
- **R > 150 m (excluded from this analysis)**: the 74 candidates at the
  ">150 m" sentinel (``buffer_metres=200``) are visible mounds inside the
  286 m corners-plus-5 px review circle but outside every review ring.
  They are **not** added as phantoms at any R in this analysis; their
  detections appear as FP at every R ≤ 150 m, which is the correct
  behaviour under the 150 m practitioner cap.


## Practitioner-useful cap: F1 at R = 125 m

(R = 125 m not computed in this run — re-run with R = 125 m included for the practitioner headline.)

## Sentinel exclusion

10 candidates at today's ">150 m" shell
(``buffer_metres=200``) are excluded from every extended-GT build in this
analysis. Their detections contribute FP at every R ≤ 150 m. Rationale in
the task brief and Obs 272.
