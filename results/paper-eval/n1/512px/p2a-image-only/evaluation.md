\* **Partial coverage** — the detection set does not cover the evaluation bounds it is scored against (tile-level detail not retained in this aggregation). Ground-truth mounds on unprocessed tiles are counted as artificial false negatives, so the POINT ESTIMATE is deflated as well as the interval; neither is comparable with a full-coverage cell. Re-score both arms against bounds the data actually covers. See erratum E72 in `docs/methodology/preregistration/protocol-errata.md` and `results/evaluation-scopes.md` § 12.
