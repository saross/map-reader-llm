**Undefined MCC** — the tile-level Matthews Correlation Coefficient is not computable here: the 2 x 2 tile confusion matrix is degenerate, so the denominator sqrt((TP+FP)(TP+FN)(TN+FP)(TN+FN)) vanishes (TP=204, TN=0, FP=136, FN=0). It is reported as `undefined` rather than 0.000, because 0 on this scale means "random" (§ 4.2 of the preregistration) and would assert a measurement that was not made. See erratum E81 in `docs/methodology/preregistration/protocol-errata.md`.
